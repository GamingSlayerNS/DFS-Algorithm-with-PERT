# DFS Algorithm with Topological Order and PERT:
UTD CS 3345 Project PERT

Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible along each branch of a graph before backtracking. DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path between two nodes, especially if the graph has cycles. If finding the shortest path is required, algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm are more appropriate.
