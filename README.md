# DFS Algorithm with Topological Order and PERT:
UTD CS 3345 Project PERT

Implement the PERT algorithm discussed in class.  Starter code (PERT.java) provided.
Implement all the methods in the starter code.
Driver code (P4Driver) and test cases are all also provided. (See p4 folder in ths shared box folder.)

Do not change the name of the class.  Do not modify Graph class.
Do not change the signatures of public methods in the starter code.
If you need additional classes, define them as nested classes of PERT.
You must write the DFS-based algorithm for finding a topological order.
